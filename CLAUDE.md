# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is a new, empty repository with only a git initialization. No source code, package files, or documentation currently exists.

## Getting Started

When adding code to this repository, consider:
- Initialize with appropriate package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Set up basic project structure based on the intended technology stack
- Add a README.md to document the project's purpose and setup instructions
- Consider adding a .gitignore file for the chosen technology stack

## Development Workflow

Since this is an empty repository, standard development commands will need to be established once the project structure is created.
